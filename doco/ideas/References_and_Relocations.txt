Vocabulary Reference
--------------------
Offset      DWORD   Byte offset into segment
Context     WORD    Dep# in §DEPS (0 for own vocabulary)
Type        BYTE    REF_VOCAB
Segment     BYTE    Segment# of vocabulary (any of §DICT §CODE §DATA §TEXT §STAB §RELS §DEPS)

External Symbol Reference
-------------------------
Offset      DWORD   Byte offset from symbol entry point
Context     WORD    Dep# in §DEPS (0 for own vocabulary)
Type        BYTE    REF_EXTRN
Symbol      BYTE    Symbol# in §STAB of context


Virtual Reference (VREF)
------------------------

A VREF must have the following parts:
• Vocabulary
• Segment within vocabulary
• Offset within segment

The parts are referenced as
• Vocabulary: index of dependency in the global vocabulary directory
• Segment: segment number
• Offset: as itself

Resolution of a VREF:
A VREF is resolved into an address by getting the address of the specified vocabulary, looking up
the specified segment and then adding the specified offset.

In a serialized isolated vocabulary, the vocabulary is instead referenced as a dependency table index.
Therefore, the address of the dependency (DEP.ADDR) must be set to the address of the loaded
vocabulary to which the dependency refers.

Global Vocabulary Directory
===========================

Vocabulary Directory
--------------------
@VDIR       CELL    Address of directory
#VDIR       CELL    Size of directory
VDIR#       CELL    Length of directory

Vocabulary Entry
----------------
Address     CELL    Address of vocabulary


Preparing a Vocabulary
======================

 1. Load vocabulary
 2. Make entry in vocabulary directory -> directory entry number DEN-0
 3. For each DEP_VOCAB entry in the dependency table:
     1. load vocabulary -> directory entry number DEN-n
     2. replace DEP.GBAL with DEN-n
     3. replace all contexts in relocation table with DEN-n
 4. replace all contexts in relocation +
